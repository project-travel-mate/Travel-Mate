A must-have app for those interested in travel. The app provides users with various features from **choosing the correct destination** to **making all the bookings** and to **easily organizing the trip**. The platform basically uses a [mash-up technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)). The app provides solutions for every possible problem a traveller might face during the course of his or her entire journey.

## How Travel Mate Works

While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered to make the trip a memorable one. Our platform helps the traveller with anything and everything that he or she might need, from the moment he or she plans the journey till the time he or she is back home happy and content.
The platform includes a wide variety of options - from selection of Mode of Transport, to finding out about the destination city, to provision of best music, novels, depending on the mood of the traveller. Travel Mate basically works in 3 phases. 

## Select Destination
A comprehensive list of all the information one would need to know about a city, be it current weather of the city or a list of best hangout places there. Along with the information, the current trend of the city on twitter can also be seen. (It is extracted from Twitter using Twitter and Yahoo! APIs).
Based on this information and the recommendation from the app, user can opt for the preferred destination location.
